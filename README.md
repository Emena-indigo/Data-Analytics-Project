### Project Overview
This sales performance project provides a comprehensive overview of Maxi.ng Ltd's business from 2019 to 2021. It covers key metrics like total sales, average sales, profitability, and sales contributions by managers and supervisors. The analysis also highlights quarterly sales trends, top-selling product categories, and sales channel performance. This information can help the company identify strengths, opportunities for improvement, and strategic priorities moving forward.

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'SalesData.csv' file that contains detailed record about each sale made by the company

### Tool
Excell:
- Power Query.
- Power Pivot

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation 
In the data preparation phase, we performed the following task:

- Data loading and inpection
- Handling missing values
- Data Cleaning and formatting
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA conducted on the dataset involves exploring the data to uncover key insights such as:
1.  How has the company's overall sales and profitability performed in the 2019-2021 period?
2.  Which sales managers and supervisors have been the top contributors?
3.  How do the company's different sales channels perform in terms of revenue contribution?
4.  What are the top-selling product categories, and how do they compare to the overall sales quota?

### Results and Findings
Based on the sales performance analysis, the key findings are:
1. Total sales of $17.9M with a 60% profit margin
2. Top sales contributors were Manager Gabriel Azevedo (51%) and Supervisor Victor Castro (49%)
3. Quarterly sales have steadily increased year-over-year, up to 18% in the latest quarter
4. Top product categories by sales are Wheat Flour, Oil, and Yeasts
5. Sales quota is $16.4M, with 91% allocated to Food products
6. Distributor and Retail channels account for the majority of sales

### Recommendation
1. Explore opportunities for new product development: Analyze the 9% sales quota allocated to Drink products to identify potential whitespace for new product innovations.
2. Prioritize the high-demand product categories: Focus sales and marketing efforts on the top-selling categories like Wheat Flour, Oil, and Yeasts to capitalize on existing market demand.
3.Implement data-driven sales forecasting: Use the historical quarterly sales trends to develop more accurate sales forecasting models and improve inventory management.

 ### Limitation.
 - I removed a customer age column from the dataset due to errors and inconsistencies which would have provided more insight about the kind of customers that patronizes the business. 
 -  Absence of customer-level data: Information about customer acquisition, retention, and purchasing patterns could reveal opportunities to better target and serve key customer segments
 -  Absence of market and competitor information: Understanding the broader industry context and competitive landscape would help contextualize the company's sales performance
